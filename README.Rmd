This file describes how run_analysis.R works.

* Download the data from [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 

* Unzip and rename it "Data"

* Make sure the "Data" folder is in the Working Directory

* Run the run_analysis file in Rstudio

* You will find two text files generated in the Working Directory
    + data.txt: the tidy data set generated from step 4
    + data_mean.txt: the tidy data set generated from step 5
